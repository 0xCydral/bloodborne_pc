Bloodborne (bbport) for Windows
===============================

No game files are included. You need your own decrypted dump of Bloodborne CUSA03173
(the folder with eboot.bin, sce_module, sce_sys, dvdroot_ps4), or the PlayStation 4 .pkg files
of the game (see "Installing from .pkg files"). Game version 1.09 is needed for the community
patches (60/90/unlocked FPS, resolution, effects); other versions run at 30 FPS.

Requirements
- Windows 10 (1903 or later) or Windows 11, 64-bit.
- A Vulkan 1.3 graphics card with a current driver.
- About 6 GB of free memory commit (RAM + page file), 10 GB for 1440p/4K output.
  Nothing else: Python and the libraries are inside this folder.

Starting
- BLauncher.exe opens the launcher. On "Game & effects" pick your game folder, adjust the
  settings, press PLAY. The "Play" page checks the game version, saves, graphics card and
  FSR 4 assets.
- Bloodborne.exe starts the game straight away with the settings saved in the launcher,
  without opening it. Set things up once in BLauncher.exe, then use Bloodborne.exe (or a
  shortcut to it, or "Add to Steam" on the Play page). If no game folder is chosen
  yet it opens the launcher. BLauncher.exe --play does the same. The log goes to
  user\last_run.log. Advanced -> "Close the launcher when the game starts" closes the launcher
  once the game window is up (not while mods are prepared, which can take 30 to 40 seconds with
  large mods); the game writes user\last_run.log itself, so it keeps filling after that.
- Add to Steam (Play page) writes a non-Steam game shortcut to Bloodborne.exe into the
  shortcuts.vdf of every Steam account on this PC (Steam's userdata\<id>\config folder) and keeps
  the old file as shortcuts.vdf.bak. Steam rewrites that file as it exits, so close Steam fully
  first (the launcher refuses while it runs), press the button, then start Steam. Pressing it
  again updates the entry for the same Bloodborne.exe instead of adding a second one.
- Installing from .pkg files: "Install from PKG..." (on the Play page, and on "Game & effects")
  opens one window. "Choose PKG files..." takes the game .pkg (about 31 GB), the v1.09 update
  .pkg and the DLC .pkg of Bloodborne; "Scan a folder..." looks for .pkg files in a folder and
  its subfolders (3 levels deep). Each file is listed with what it is (game, update version,
  DLC), and the best game, the highest update and the DLC are ticked for you; files that are
  not Bloodborne are listed with the reason and cannot be ticked. Both dialogs open in the
  folder you used last (else Downloads). "Install into" defaults to a "game" folder next to
  BLauncher.exe; about 1.1 times the size of the files must be free, and Install stays off
  until the space is there. The launcher extracts the game, applies the update over it, sets
  the game folder and runs the ready check. The game takes 15 to 30 minutes; the launcher
  stays usable and "Stop" cancels. A package PkgTool cannot read (encrypted, unsupported) is
  reported with PkgTool's own message. The DLC .pkg holds only the license:
  its label (SPEXPANSIONDLC03, The Old Hunters) is saved and reported to the game as BB_ADDCONT
  (Game & effects -> "DLC", with a Clear button). Only Bloodborne packages are accepted
  (CUSA03173, CUSA00900, CUSA00207, CUSA01363, CUSA03023); an update other than 01.09 is
  accepted with a warning. PkgTool needs the .NET Framework 4, which Windows 10 and 11 include.
- Advanced -> "Desktop shortcut" puts Bloodborne on the desktop.
- Updates: when a new version is out, a card at the top right of the launcher says so; "Update"
  downloads and installs it and opens the launcher again (saves, settings and mods are kept).
  Advanced -> "Check for updates" checks by hand. Only stable versions are offered unless
  Advanced -> "Beta versions" is on (it is on by default while you run a beta, and a beta user
  is still offered the final release when it comes out).
- Advanced -> "Launcher language": English, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, French,
  German, Italian, Polish, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean (default: the Windows language).
- Advanced -> Display & FPS -> "Monitor" (shown with more than one monitor) picks the monitor
  the game opens on; "Primary monitor" is the default. The launcher saves the monitor's name and
  starts the game with BB_DISPLAY set to it. If that monitor is not connected the launcher says
  so and the game uses the primary one. BB_DISPLAY also takes a monitor number (1, 2, ...).
- Advanced -> "Experimental features" (off by default) unlocks options that are still being
  tested; the launcher marks them (experimental). For now that is object motion vectors on AMD
  graphics cards, which the game keeps off there because they cost frame rate and drew some
  objects wrong with frame generation. With the switch on and "Object motion vectors" on
  (Graphics), the launcher starts the game with BB_OBJECT_MOTION_AMD=1.
- In the game, Insert (or L3+R3 on a gamepad) opens the port's menu (upscaler, resolution,
  effects). Keyboard (Dark Souls III layout; the Controls tab of the launcher changes it): WASD move,
  mouse or IJKL camera, Space Circle, E/Enter Cross, R Square, F Triangle, left/right button R1/L1,
  Shift + button R2/L2, Left Ctrl L2, C L3, Q R3, arrows or wheel d-pad, Esc Options (menu),
  Tab or G left touchpad (gestures), Backspace right touchpad.
- The buttons the game shows follow your controller: Xbox icons for an Xbox pad, PlayStation icons for a
  PlayStation pad, your keys and mouse buttons with none (Controls > Button icons picks one by hand). They
  are redrawn at start from your own copy of the game and kept in out\icons; nothing in the game folder changes.

Data
- Saves and shader caches: user\ next to BLauncher.exe (the launcher can pick another folder).
- Settings: bbport.ini next to BLauncher.exe; launcher options in %APPDATA%\bbport-launcher.
- Generated files (prepared game image, patches): out\.

Cheats
- The "Cheats" page has cheats (never die, enemies do not see or hear you, Rally never fades,
  control the targeted enemy) and gameplay tweaks (no Rally, camera further away, no camera
  auto-rotation, run with less stick tilt, ragdoll physics). They are game patches for 1.09,
  applied when the game starts.

Problems
- Black screen at start: Advanced -> "Clear shader cache", then start again (the first minutes
  stutter while the cache is rebuilt).
- Send user\last_run.log with any bug report.

Upscaling
- DLSS: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 series or newer with a current driver (Graphics -> Upscaler ->
  DLSS, or the in-game menu). On other GPUs the option is greyed out.
- XeSS (Intel XeSS Super Resolution 2.0.2, from the XeSS SDK 3.0.2, bin\libxess.dll): for AMD, Intel
  and NVIDIA GPUs with DP4a support, a good choice where FSR 4 is slow or missing (for example
  Radeon RX 6000). It has no sharpener of its own: the Sharpness setting adds one.
- FSR 3.1 works on every GPU. FSR 4 needs its assets in fsr4_shaders\ (included in this
  package, or Graphics -> "Download FSR 4 assets"); GPUs without the required shader features
  fall back to FSR 3.1 by themselves.
- The launcher checks what your PC can run: upscalers it cannot are marked "not available" with the
  reason and cannot be picked. If the saved one cannot run, the launcher switches to DLSS (RTX
  GPUs) or FSR 3.1 and says so once. FSR 4 is allowed on Radeon RX 5000/6000 GPUs but marked "may
  be slow".

FSR 4.1.1 (experimental)
- The built-in FSR 4.1.1 needs a Vulkan extension (VK_VALVE_shader_mixed_float_dot_product) that
  no Windows driver offers yet. On Windows the game can instead use fsr4vk
  (https://github.com/dvj5411/fsr4vk), a separate program that runs the same AMD model. It is
  experimental: here it was checked on a GeForce RTX 4070 and a Radeon RX 6600.
- It is off until you opt in, and it is not in this zip. To use it:
  1. Advanced -> Performance -> turn on "Experimental features".
  2. Graphics -> "FSR 4.1.1 (experimental)" -> "Download FSR 4.1.1" (about 14 MB, once).
  3. Graphics -> Upscaler -> "FSR 4.1.1 (experimental)".
  If you downloaded it with an earlier version, the same place offers "Update FSR 4.1.1": the new
  build makes it work on AMD cards.
- The download is fsr4vk v0.4.3 with one fix for AMD's Windows driver, built by this port and
  hosted on its GitHub release next to its source (fsr4vk-v0.4.3-amdfix-src.zip). It is checked
  against a fixed SHA-256 and goes to the fsr4vk folder next to BLauncher.exe. Launcher updates
  leave that folder alone. fsr4vk is GPL-3.0; its licenses and SOURCE.txt are in the fsr4vk folder
  after the download. The game loads it as a separate program and does not include its code.
- Until the files are downloaded and Experimental features is on, the entry is greyed out and says
  why. If it was your saved upscaler and either goes away, the launcher switches to DLSS (RTX GPUs)
  or FSR 3.1 and says so once.
- Cost on a GeForce RTX 4070, 1080p output from 720p: about 2.4 ms per frame, against about 2.0 ms
  for FSR 4 and 0.55 ms for FSR 3.1. Measured once, not a benchmark.

Frame generation (optional)
- Graphics -> "Frame generation" (also on the Play page and in the in-game menu, or
  frame_generation=1 in bbport.ini, or BB_FRAME_GEN=1 for one run) shows one interpolated frame
  between every two game frames: 60 FPS of the game are shown as 120. It is AMD's FidelityFX
  frame interpolation and optical flow, driven by the game's depth and motion vectors, and it
  works with every upscaler (FSR 4, FSR 4.1.1, FSR 3.1, DLSS, XeSS or TAA). The HUD of the game
  frame is kept over the interpolated frame, so it does not smear. Default: off.
- With DLSS as the upscaler on a GeForce RTX 40 series or newer, the interpolated frame comes
  from NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation instead ("Frame generation: on (NVIDIA DLSS Frame
  Generation, ...)" in the log). It needs a current driver, Windows hardware-accelerated GPU
  scheduling (Settings -> System -> Display -> Graphics) and bin\nvngx_dlssg.dll. Without any of
  these the log says "DLSS Frame Generation unavailable (reason); using AMD frame interpolation"
  and AMD's runs, as it does with every other upscaler. It is the same switch, with the same
  pacing, frame cap and input lag; there is no multi-frame generation.
- It costs input lag: the game frame is shown about half a frame interval later than without
  it. Best with at least 60 FPS before generation; below that the interpolated frames show
  more artifacts and the lag is more noticeable.
- It is off, with a line in the log, when the upscaler is Off, with HDR output, and when the
  scene is rendered larger than the window. While the game runs faster than half of the
  display's refresh rate there is no room for a second image per frame: generation pauses
  ("Frame generation: idle, base FPS above half the refresh rate" in the log) and returns when
  the rate falls. For example on a 144 Hz display it works up to about 65 FPS of the game.
- Menus, loading screens and movies are shown as they are; generation restarts with the scene.
- With vertical sync (present mode Fifo, which AMD GPUs use on Windows; BB_PRESENT_MODE) the
  display paces the two images. With Mailbox or Immediate the port shows the interpolated frame
  and then the game frame half a frame interval later.
- You do not need to pick a frame cap. With frame generation on, the launcher caps the game at
  half of your display's refresh rate (at most 120 FPS, at least 30; 60 when the refresh rate
  cannot be read): 72 FPS shown as 144 on a 144 Hz display, 90 as 180 on 180 Hz, 120 as 240 on
  240 Hz or faster. A cap at or below half of the refresh rate keeps generation on all the time:
  it leaves a refresh slot for every interpolated image ("Frame generation: frame cap N FPS
  fits half the refresh rate (R Hz): always on" in the log). The Simple page shows the result
  under the switch, for example "Up to 72 game FPS, 144 on your 144 Hz screen." On a display
  under 100 Hz it says generation helps little and is better left off.
- With frame generation off, "Auto" sets no cap: the game runs as fast as it can.
- The Advanced view (Display & FPS) lets you pick a cap yourself: 60, 90 or 120 FPS, 144, 165 or
  240 FPS (marked with a warning: above 120 FPS the game's movement timing breaks), or No limit.
  A cap of 60 shows 120 images a second. The line under the list says what the choice gives with
  your switch; a cap whose double does not fit the display ("Too high to double on your 144 Hz
  screen") makes generation pause while the game runs above half of the refresh rate, and
  "Auto" fixes it. A frame cap saved by v1.6.13 as "Half the refresh rate" now reads Auto.
- The FPS counter reads "60 -> 120 FPS FG" while it works. With BB_FRAME_STATS=1 the log gets
  "Frame generation: N generated/s, M presented/s, base B FPS, X skipped" every 5 seconds.
- ReShade and other overlays see every shown image, so twice as many presents as game frames.

ReShade (optional)
- Graphics -> "ReShade" (or "ReShade look" on the Play page) switches it on for the next game
  start: two presets, Natural (sharpening, deband, a little contrast and colour) and Vivid (more
  contrast and colour, a light vignette). ReShade 6.8.0 and the effects are inside this package
  (bin\reshade\); nothing is installed on the system and nothing changes while it is off.
  Measured on an RTX 4070 it costs about 0.3 ms per frame at 1080p and 0.5 ms at 1440p, 3 to 4%
  of the frame at about 75 FPS. It does not read the game's depth, so there are no depth-based
  effects (the game has its own depth of field and ambient occlusion).
- In the game press Home to open ReShade's menu (Print Screen saves a screenshot to
  bin\reshade\screenshots\). Changes are saved in the preset in use.
- Your own presets: bin\reshade\presets\*.ini (create them in ReShade's menu, or copy .ini files
  there; "Open presets folder" opens it). They show up in the dropdowns. Updates keep
  bin\reshade\ReShade.ini and every preset already there, so your edits survive; delete a preset
  file to get the shipped one back with the next update. ReShade's log is bin\reshade\ReShade.log.
- It is a Vulkan layer enabled only for the game process (VK_ADD_LAYER_PATH, VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS and
  RESHADE_BASE_PATH_OVERRIDE are set by the launcher), so a ReShade installed on the system is not
  involved. Licences: licenses\ReShade-*.txt.

Mods and patches
- Put each mod in its own folder under mods\ (dvdroot_ps4\..., or chr\, parts\, ... directly);
  enable and order them on "Mods & patches". The game files are never changed. Without Windows
  Developer Mode the port links folders with junctions and files with hard links; when the game
  is on another drive, the temporary mod view is made next to the game folder.
- Third-party patches: shadPS4/GoldHEN XML files for 1.09 in patches\.
